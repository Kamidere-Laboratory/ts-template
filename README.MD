Features<small> I think ðŸ¤”</small>:
- Use of `ts-node/esm` give advantage of skiping whole transcompilation process without sacrificing type errors <small>little disadvantage with old modules, but who cares?</small>.
- DI/IoC via Awilix with domain separation (your developers will love it ðŸ˜ˆ)
- Pino logger (ultra fast json logger) and Preaty-Pino to make your logs cute as f*** for debuging :P
- pnpm for reducing precious disk space<small>(to store more anime)</small> also it's pretty fast, not gonna lie.
- Splits config into two files `.env` and `secret.json`. <small> Is not confusing at all, trust me :D</small>
- All imports from your code need to be ended with `.js`
- Eslint and Prettier to keep your code from looking like garbage.
